# Computer-Vision-Final-Project
This repository has the implementation of our final project of Computer Vision for Session 2020-21 which was taught by Dr. Mayank Vatsa.

In this project were to compare and contrast the performace of classical machine learning models vs deep learning models on their performance on Emotion Detection.
We use the dataset fromt the FER(Facial Emotion Recognition) Challenge. It contain almost 30K images for training and 3.5K for Validation and Testing with each image
labelled as one of the 7 categories of Emotion such as anger or happiness.

We Evaluate and contrast performance on 8 different type of models:
The features were extracted using 4 methods (2 hand crafted and 2 deep learning) and there were 2 classifiers(SVM and FC classifier).

We would soon be updating our refactored code, weights of models and dataset implementation details

* Please bear with us in these busy times, we are working hard so that you can reproduce the smae results *

Please, feel free to ping us for any doubt.
